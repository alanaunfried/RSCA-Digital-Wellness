#read in spss file using haven package
raw_data <- read_sav("data/Copy of Digital Wellness Survey_Merged_05.29.25_JL.sav")

#basic variable cleanup
data <- raw_data %>% 
  clean_names() # snake_case column names

#preview variables
head(data)
```

Preview of variable names

```{r}
names(data)
```

## Clean Data

Filter to population, remove hasty responses, etc.

```{r}

#suspicious response filtering is not currently working


data1 <- data |>
  filter(sona == 1) |>
  filter(suspicious_response != 1)
```
